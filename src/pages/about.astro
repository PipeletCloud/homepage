    <p>We're solving a problem that affects everyone: working with data from many sources. Pipelet lets you build workflows to ingest, transform, and output data â€” without the need to set up multiple services like Grafana or Prometheus, or learn complex UNIX tooling. It's an end-to-end solution for powerful, flexible data manipulation.</p>
